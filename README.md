# SM3DW-Level-Editor
This is what may become a nice level editor in the future, but at the moment, it can only move and rotate objects and change some of their settings.

Controls are:<br>
I,K: Rotate X<br>
O,L: Rotate Y<br>
P,;: Rotate Z<br>
A,S,D,W: Move<br>
Q,E: Zoom in/out<br>

Requires Python 2.X (tested with 2.7), PyQt4 and PyOpenGL to run.
