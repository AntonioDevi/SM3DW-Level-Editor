# SM3DW-Level-Editor
This is a nice little level editor I made. At the moment, it can only move and rotate objects and change some of their settings (string editing is broken). Adding/deleting objects may be added in the future. It can only save edited levels as byml files, you'll have to repack and compress them yourself.

Controls are:<br>
Left mouse button + drag to move camera<br>
Right mouse button + drag to rotate camera<br>
Scroll wheel to zoom

Alternatively use these keys (holding shift makes them faster):<br>
I,K: Rotate X<br>
O,L: Rotate Y<br>
P,;: Rotate Z<br>
A,S,D,W: Move<br>
Q,E: Zoom in/out

Here's a (outdated) preview of the editor: https://youtu.be/i5I19UA2FBQ<br>
I'm now able to test custom stuff on my Wii U, so I made a video of a little edit I made to High Bounce Highlands. Watch it here: https://youtu.be/UzIFnSWh9yA

Requires Python 2.X (tested with 2.7), PyQt4 and PyOpenGL to run.
