# SM3DW-Level-Editor
This is what may become a nice level editor in the future, but at the moment, it can only move and rotate objects.

Controls are:
    I,K: Rotate X
    O,L: Rotate Y
    P,;: Rotate Z
    A,S,D,W: Move
    Q,E: Zoom in/out

Requires Python 2.X (tested with 2.7), PyQt4 and PyOpenGL to run.
