# SM3DW-Level-Editor
This is a nice little level editor I made. At the moment, it can only move and rotate objects and change their settings. Adding/deleting objects may be added in the future. It can only save edited levels as byml files, you'll have to repack and compress them yourself. Since I can't test edits on a Wii U, some things might be broken.

Controls are:<br>
I,K: Rotate X<br>
O,L: Rotate Y<br>
P,;: Rotate Z<br>
A,S,D,W: Move<br>
Q,E: Zoom in/out<br>

Requires Python 2.X (tested with 2.7), PyQt4 and PyOpenGL to run.
